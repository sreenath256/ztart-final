        <p>The United States continues to rank among the world's most visited nations due to
        its wealth of tourist attractions and enormous commercial potential. But applying for
        a visa can take a while, and the rules are stringent.</p>

        <h4>Current Considerations:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Due to high demand, visa processing times for non-VWP travelers may
          extend beyond several months in 2024. It's advisable to start the visa
          application process early.</li>
          <li>ESTA approval for VWP travelers is usually swift, but applying at least 72
          hours before travel is recommended.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Visa Application Process:</h4>
        <p>Apply for a U.S. visa through the official U.S. Embassy

        <h4>Current Considerations:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Schengen visa appointments may face delays due to increased demand in
          2024. Applying 2-3 months before your travel date is strongly recommended.</li>

          reflect its openness to welcoming more visitors in 2024.</p>

          <h4>Current Considerations:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Although Japan’s borders have fully reopened, visa applications for
            non-exempt nationalities may take longer as the government works through
            a backlog of requests from 2023.</li>
            <li>Visa-exempt travelers can enter Japan easily, but long-term or work visas may
            involve stricter requirements.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Submit a visa application at your nearest Japanese
          consulate or embassy with necessary documents like proof of funds and an itinerary.

        submitted online or through a local visa application center. You will need to provide

        processing times, and it’s essential to have all documents prepared.</p>

            <p>At Ztartvisa, we value your trust and are committed to protecting your
                privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal
                information when you visit our website and use our services. Please take
            a moment to read this policy and understand how we manage your data.</p>
            <h4 className='text-lg font-PoppinsSemibold'>1. Information We Collect</h4>
            <p>When you use our services, we may collect certain personal information
                from you. We collect these details to prepare your visa application
                according to embassy rules, not for Ztartvisa's own purposes. This
                information includes:</p>
            <ul className='list-disc ml-4 capitalize'>
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Phone number</li>

            </ul>
            <h4 className='text-lg font-PoppinsSemibold'>2.How We Use Your Information</h4>
            <p>We use the information we collect from you to prepare your visa
                application in accordance with embassy rules. Specifically, we use your
                information to:</p>
            <ul className='list-disc ml-4 capitalize'>
                <li>Prepare and manage your visa application</li>
                <li>Submit your application to the appropriate embassy or consulate</li>

            </ul>
            <h4 className='text-lg font-PoppinsSemibold'>3. How We Protect Your Information</h4>
            <p>At Ztartvisa, we take your privacy seriously. We don't keep your
documents for long – they are deleted within 30 days after your visa
submission. We keep your information for 30 days to accommodate any
additional information requests from the embassy, potential
reapplications, and to provide proof of our quality of work to our clients if
necessary. During the time we have your information, we ensure it's
protected with strong security measures to prevent unauthorized access
or disclosure.</p>
